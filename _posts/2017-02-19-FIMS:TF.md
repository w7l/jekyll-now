[Fluoroscopically Guided Interventional Transforaminal Needling for Lumbar Instability using a Specially Designed Needle Conjoining Epiduroscopic Evaluation: An Exploratory Study ](http://www.scitechnol.com/peer-review/fluoroscopically-guided-interventional-transforaminal-needling-for-lumbar-instability-using-a-specially-designed-needle-conjoining-7EjU.php?article_id=4686)   

에 새로운 FIMS technique이 소개되었다.     




Target point는 AP, axial view에서 각기 다음과 같다
>AP view  
The concept of transforaminal access of the curved Round Needle into the interface between the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) and annulus fibrosus (AF), below the inferior end plate, with the concave surface facing upwards is demonstrated using a schematic diagram in the coronal plane  ![그림](/images/FIMS/FIMS1.jpg)    

>Axial view  
Introduction of the curved Round Needle into the interface between the PLL and vertebral body is demonstrated using a schematic diagram in the axial plane

시행 근거는 다음 두가지로 요약된다
>We consider that dry needling using a 1 diameter needle may release the adhesion of the dural sac and nerve roots from the surrounding tissue, thus improving the mobility of the dural sac and nerve roots and alleviating pain.  

>Needling into the anterior epidural space, PLL, and Annulus fibrosus may reduce hypersensitivity of the sinuvertebral nerve   

고려사항   

수기적으로 매우 challenging하며, 추후 행쿠에서 alternative technique을 논의한다.
